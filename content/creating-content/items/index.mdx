# Custom Items

Oraxen lets you create custom items with unique textures, models, and abilities. Items are the foundation of all custom content in Oraxen.

## What You Can Create

| Item Type | Examples | Key Features |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Weapons | Swords, axes, bows | Custom damage, abilities, durability |
| Tools | Pickaxes, shovels, hoes | Mining abilities, custom efficiency |
| Food | Custom consumables | Hunger, effects, custom eating |
| Materials | Gems, ingots, components | For crafting recipes |
| Equipment | Armor pieces | See [Custom Armors](/creating-content/armors) |

## Configuration Overview

| Section | Purpose | Documentation |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `displayname` | Item name with colors | Use MiniMessage format |
| `material` | Base Minecraft item | Any valid material |
| `Pack` | Textures and models | [Item Appearance](/creating-content/items/appearance) |
| `Components` | Vanilla data components | [Components](/creating-content/items/components) |
| `Mechanics` | Special abilities | [Abilities](/creating-content/items/abilities) |

## Basic Item Structure

```yaml
my_item:
  displayname: "<gradient:#4B36B1:#6699FF>My Item"
  material: DIAMOND_SWORD
  Pack:
    generate_model: true
    parent_model: "item/handheld"
    textures:
      - my_item.png
  Mechanics:
    durability:
      value: 2000
```

<Callout type="info">
Place your texture files in the `plugins/Oraxen/pack/textures/` folder. Oraxen automatically generates the resource pack.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

- [Item Appearance](/creating-content/items/appearance) - Textures, models, and custom visuals
- [Components](/creating-content/items/components) - Enchantments, attributes, lore
- [Abilities](/creating-content/items/abilities) - Special powers and mechanics

## Tutorial: Create Your First Item

Let's create a custom Onyx Axe step by step.

## 1. Let's start by creating textures

For this tutorial I will make a simple item in 2d and Oraxen will generate the model, but if you want you can use software like [cubik.studio](https://cubik.studio/) (paid) or [blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net) (free + opensource) which are both excellent.

Here's what I did in 16x16 (so it still looks like vanilla minecraft) on Photoshop:

![photoshop screenshot](/assets/photoshop.png)

I then save the file under the name _onyx_axe.png_.

## 2. The basic configuration

I couldn't decide where to add my axe (is it more of a tool or a weapon?) so I created my **super_cool_items.yml** file under items directory. Here is what I wrote:

```yaml
onyx_axe:
  displayname: "<#6f737d>Onyx Axe"
  material: DIAMOND_AXE
```

So I put a name to my item and chose to use the diamond axe as a base. In the [Components](/creating-content/items/components) section you will see many other possibilities of additional modifications (like how to use enchantments, itemflags, attributes, etc).

## 3. Let's assign the texture to the item

Normally you would need to create json files manually: one for the model and another to specify when to display it. With Oraxen, you just specify the textures for your item. Oraxen handles all the resource pack generation automatically—see [Item Appearance](/creating-content/items/appearance) for full details.

```yaml
onyx_axe:
  displayname: "<black>Onyx Axe"
  material: DIAMOND_AXE
  Pack:
    generate_model: true
    parent_model: "item/handheld"
    textures:
      - onyx_axe.png
```

As you can see I've set parent_model to "item/handheld", it is the parent model used by tools while the one used by stuff like diamonds for example is "item/generated", this is what defines how the item appears in the hand (if you don't do this your weapon may be held weridly).

I also need to drag my **onyx_axe.png** texture into the **/pack/textures** folder of Oraxen. From this configuration I could normally already restart the server and see my item but I want to add cool powers to it.


You can also use a json model to create 3d items, see [Item Appearance](/creating-content/items/appearance) for the documentation.


## 4. Let's improve our item with mechanics

In the configuration of each item you can add a mechanics section and add lots of cool things in it. By the way, if you find that there are not enough cool features (although I try to add as many as possible) you can add some via other plugins that use Oraxen's api (see [Create your own Mechanic](/developers/mechanics)). I would like my axe to have a huge durability and to be able to break bedrock. Here is what I wrote:

```yaml
onyx_axe:
  displayname: "<black>Onyx Axe"
  material: DIAMOND_AXE
  Pack:
    generate_model: true
    parent_model: "item/handheld"
    textures:
      - onyx_axe.png
  Mechanics:
    durability:
      value: 20000
    bedrockbreak:
      delay: 0
      period: 10
      probability: 0.5
```

A durability of 20,000 is ludicrous, to compare diamond tools have a 1,561 one. I put a probability of 0.5 for loot when you mine the bedrock with it because I want the bedrock block to remain difficult to obtain.


For some mechanics it is necessary to use ProtocolLib, this is the case for bedrockbreak


## 5. Let's try it!

I begin by restarting the server and when it is good I will install the texture pack.zip pack generated in the /pack/ folder of Oraxen.

I give myself the axe from the inventory via /o inv and this is what I get:

![Me and my onyx axe](/assets/2019-11-01_10.02.47.png)

I'm also able to mine bedrock:

![Me breaking bedrock with my onyx axe](/assets/2019-11-01_10.03.22.png)


If you have come this far, congratulations you have created your own item 👍
