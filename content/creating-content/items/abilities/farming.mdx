# Farming Mechanics

### Harvesting

Harvesting allows you to recolt and replant automatically wheat in a certain radius.

#### Per item configuration

```yaml
Mechanics:
  harvesting:
    cooldown: 10000 # 10 seconds between usages
    radius: 5 # blocks surrounding the clicked block
    height: 3 # blocks above the clicked block
    lower_item_durability: true # whether harvesting reduces tool durability (default: true)
```

### BigMining

Bigmining allows you to mine different blocks at the same time. By default this mechanic is used on the hammers and allows you to mine 3x3 square and more.

#### Per item configuration

```yaml
Mechanics:
  bigmining:
    radius: 1 # blocks surrounding the broken block
    depth: 1
```

### Smelting

Smelting allows you to instantly melt iron and gold ores when you mine them. This supports fortune and silktouch.

#### Per item configuration

```yaml
Mechanics:
  smelting:
    enabled: true
    play_sound: true
```

### BottledExp

This allows to transform your experience into bottles of experience with a right click. You can configure a loss percentage.

#### Per item configuration

The ratio corresponds to the quantity of exp transformed into a bottle for one exp.

```yaml
Mechanics:
  bottledexp:
    ratio: 0.95 # So you'll lose 1/20 of your exp by converting it
```

#### Global configuration

```yaml
bottledexp:
  enabled: true
  durability_cost: 1
```

### BedrockBreak


This mechanic depends on ProtocolLib, if you can't use ProtocolLib, you need to disable it


#### Per item configuration

The hardness is the amount of ticks between breaking animation switch and probability is the percentage of chance to get the bedrock (0.10 for 10%, 0.5 for 50% or 1.0 for 100%).

```yaml
Mechanics:
  bedrockbreak:
    hardness: 10
    probability: 1
```

#### Global configuration

If you set disable_on_first_layer to true, your players will no longer be able to break the ground (layer 0), the durability_cost is the amount of durability the item you've set bedrockbreak

```yaml
bedrockbreak:
  enabled: true
  disable_on_first_layer: false
  durability_cost: 500
```

### Watering

Create a watering can system for your farm. This mechanic requires two items: an empty can and a filled can. The empty can fills when right-clicking water or a water cauldron. The filled can waters farmland (vanilla or Oraxen farm blocks).

#### Per item configuration

You need to define both items and link them together:

```yaml
empty_watering_can:
  displayname: "<gray>Empty Watering Can"
  material: PAPER
  Mechanics:
    watering:
      filledCanItem: filled_watering_can

filled_watering_can:
  displayname: "<aqua>Filled Watering Can"
  material: PAPER
  Mechanics:
    watering:
      emptyCanItem: empty_watering_can
```

The empty can turns into the filled can when filling with water, and vice versa when watering farmland.
