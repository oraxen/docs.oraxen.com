## Content Types

## Quick Start

New to Oraxen? Follow this recommended learning path:

1. **[Understanding the Basics](/plugin-setup/understanding-the-basics)** - Learn how Oraxen works
2. **[Create Your First Item](/creating-content/items)** - Make a simple custom item
3. **[Item Appearance](/creating-content/items/appearance)** - Add textures and models
4. **[Add Abilities](/creating-content/items/abilities)** - Give your items special powers

## How Content Creation Works

All custom content in Oraxen follows a similar pattern:

```yaml
my_custom_item:
  displayname: "<gradient:#4B36B1:#6699FF>My Item"
  material: DIAMOND_SWORD
  Pack:
    generate_model: true
    parent_model: "item/handheld"
    textures:
      - my_texture.png
  Mechanics:
    # Add special abilities here
```

1. **Define the item** - Set display name, base material
2. **Configure appearance** - Textures, models, colors
3. **Add mechanics** - Special abilities and behaviors
4. **Test in-game** - Use `/oraxen reload` and `/oraxen give`
