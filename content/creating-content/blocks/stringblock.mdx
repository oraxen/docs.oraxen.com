# StringBlock

The StringBlock mechanic allows you to create custom blocks using Minecraft's tripwire states. This provides up to **127 unique block variations** and is ideal for plants, flowers, and other decorative elements.

<Callout type="info">

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Paper Server Recommended**

For best performance, enable this setting in `config/paper-global.yml`:
```yaml
block-updates:
  disable-tripwire-updates: true
```
</Callout>

## How Does It Work?

StringBlocks use tripwire-based hitboxes, allowing you to make small decorative objects that players can walk through. They are more optimized than furniture for simple decorations.

**Key features:**
- Players can walk through StringBlocks
- Waterloggable (can be placed underwater)
- Variations 65-127 have smaller hitboxes than 1-64

### Global Configuration

```yaml
stringblock:
  tool_types:
    - WOODEN
    - STONE
    - IRON
    - GOLDEN
    - DIAMOND
    - NETHERITE
  enabled: true
```

## Creating a Decoration

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
jasmine_flower:
  displayname: "<white>Jasmine Flower"
  material: PAPER
  Pack:
    generate_model: true
    parent_model: "block/cross"
    textures:
      - custom/flowers/jasmine_flower.png
  Mechanics:
    stringblock:
      custom_variation: 2
      model: jasmine_flower
      hardness: 2
      drop:
        silktouch: false
        loots:
          - { oraxen_item: jasmine_flower, probability: 1.0 }
```

## Block Features

### Tall Plants

Create two-block-tall plants like vanilla tall grass or sunflowers:
```yaml
Mechanics:
  stringblock:
    custom_variation: 5
    is_tall: true  # Creates a 2-block tall plant
```

### Random Placement

Randomly choose from a list of blocks when placed (great for varied flower patches):
```yaml
Mechanics:
  stringblock:
    custom_variation: 10
    random_place:
      blocks:
        - red_flower
        - blue_flower
        - yellow_flower
```

### Light Emission

```yaml
Mechanics:
  stringblock:
    custom_variation: 6
    light: 10  # 0-15
```

### Blast Resistant

```yaml
Mechanics:
  stringblock:
    blast_resistant: true
```

### Immovable

Prevent pistons from pushing:
```yaml
Mechanics:
  stringblock:
    immovable: true
```

### BlockLocker Protection

```yaml
Mechanics:
  stringblock:
    blocklocker:
      can_protect: true
      protection_type: CONTAINER  # CONTAINER, DOOR, or ATTACHABLE
```

## Custom Models

Use your own 3D models:

```yaml
oak_log_mini:
  displayname: "<white>oak_log_mini"
  material: PAPER
  Pack:
    generate_model: false
    model: custom/furniture/oak_log_mini
  Mechanics:
    stringblock:
      custom_variation: 3
      model: custom/furniture/oak_log_mini
      hardness: 2
      drop:
        silktouch: false
        loots:
          - { oraxen_item: oak_log_mini, probability: 1.0 }
```

## Sapling Mechanic

*Requires Oraxen 1.136.0+*

Create custom saplings that can grow into structures (trees, plants, etc.).

### Global Configuration

```yaml
stringblock:
  sapling_growth_check_delay: 4000  # Ticks between growth checks
  enabled: true
```

### Sapling Configuration

```yaml
custom_sapling:
  Mechanics:
    stringblock:
      custom_variation: 20
      sapling:
        canGrowNaturally: true       # Grows over time
        naturalGrowthTime: 6000      # Ticks until growth
        canGrowFromBoneMeal: true    # Can be bone-mealed
        boneMealGrowChance: 50       # % chance per bone meal
        growSound: block.grass.break
        minLightLevel: 4             # Minimum light to grow
        requiresWaterSource: false   # Needs nearby water
        schematicName: custom_tree   # Structure to spawn
```

<Callout type="info">
The `schematicName` refers to a schematic file that will be placed when the sapling grows. This allows you to create custom trees or any structure.
</Callout>
