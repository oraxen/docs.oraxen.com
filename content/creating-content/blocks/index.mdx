# Custom Block Mechanics

Oraxen provides several mechanics for creating custom blocks, each with different characteristics. This guide helps you choose the right one for your needs.

## Quick Comparison

| Mechanic | Max Blocks | Base Block | Best For |
|----------|------------|------------|----------|
| [NoteBlock](/creating-content/blocks/noteblock) | ~800 | Note Block | Most custom blocks (ores, stone, wood) |
| [StringBlock](/creating-content/blocks/stringblock) | 127 | Tripwire | Plants, flowers, decorations |
| [ChorusBlock](/creating-content/blocks/chorusblock) | 63 | Chorus Plant | Transparent blocks (leaves, glass-like) |
| [Furniture](/creating-content/furniture) | Unlimited | Display Entity | Complex models, interactable objects |

## Choosing the Right Mechanic

### Use NoteBlock for:
- **Solid blocks** like ores, stone variants, wood planks
- When you need the **most block slots** (~800)
- Blocks that should have **standard hitboxes**

### Use StringBlock for:
- **Plants and flowers** that players walk through
- **Small decorations** with passable hitboxes
- Blocks that need to be **waterloggable**
- **Tall plants** (2-block height)

### Use ChorusBlock for:
- **Transparent blocks** like custom leaves or glass variants
- **Single-block furniture** that needs transparency (more performant than display entities)
- Blocks where **see-through rendering** is important

### Use Furniture for:
- **Complex 3D models** (chairs, tables, machines)
- **Interactable objects** (storage, jukebox)
- **Unlimited variations** (no slot limit)
- Objects with **custom hitboxes** or **seats**

## Paper Server Configuration

<Callout type="warning">
**Strongly Recommended for Paper Servers**

For best performance and to prevent physics bugs, add these settings to `config/paper-global.yml`:

```yaml
block-updates:
  disable-noteblock-updates: true
  disable-tripwire-updates: true
  disable-chorus-plant-updates: true
```

Without these settings, Oraxen must listen to expensive physics events which can cause lag.

## Legacy: Block Mechanic (Mushroom Stem)

<Callout type="info">
The original `block` mechanic using mushroom stems still exists but is **disabled by default** and considered legacy. Use NoteBlock instead for new projects.
</Callout>

If you have existing configurations using the mushroom stem mechanic, they will continue to work. To enable it, set `enabled: true` in `mechanics.yml`:

```yaml
block:
  enabled: true  # Default: false
  tool_types:
    - WOODEN
    - STONE
    - IRON
    - GOLDEN
    - DIAMOND
    - NETHERITE
```

The configuration is identical to NoteBlock, just using `block:` instead of `noteblock:` in your item configs.

- [NoteBlock Mechanic](/creating-content/blocks/noteblock) - Best for most custom blocks
- [StringBlock Mechanic](/creating-content/blocks/stringblock) - Best for plants and decorations
- [ChorusBlock Mechanic](/creating-content/blocks/chorusblock) - Transparent blocks
- [Furniture Mechanic](/creating-content/furniture) - Complex 3D models
