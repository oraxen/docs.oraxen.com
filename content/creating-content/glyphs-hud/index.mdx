## What is a glyph?

A glyph is a textured unicode symbol. It can be used in any texts (chat, item name, lore and more). They can be used to do very, very powerful things (custom inventories, extra bars) but their simplest use is to be emoji.

## How to add a Glyph?

You first need to create a png texture. For example the heart.png file contained in `default/chat`.

![heart.png](/assets/heart%20(1).png)

You can then add your section to any yaml file from the glyphs directory. The code must be different for every glyph. This is the number that corresponds to the number of the unicode character that will be used. The texture is the path and name of the texture file. Height allows you to set the displayed character scale while ascent defines the vertical shift of the displayed result.

```yaml
heart:
  texture: default/chat/heart
  ascent: 8
  height: 8
```

## My glyphs don't work?

This is likely due to misconfiguration of the glyphs' config.  
Please check your console for any errors, as it should tell you exactly which glyph is misconfigured and how it is.

## Multi-Bitmap glyphs
If you have a png consisting of several emotes, you can make it a multi-bitmap.
This means you can, tie several glyphs to one image. This step requires some extra configuration to work however.
In fonts.yml there is a section for `bitmaps`.
Here you need to specify an `id`, which you will use in your glyph-configs.
You also need to specify the path to the texture, as well as how many rows and columns the bitmap has.
Below is an example of an entry in `fonts.yml`:

```yaml
bitmaps:
  example_bitmap:
    texture: example/example_bitmap
    rows: 4
    columns: 9
    ascent: 8
    height: 8
```
![](/assets/example_bitmap.png)

As you can see, the image shown above has 4 rows and 9 columns.
The ascent and height property will be the one used for all glyphs tied to this bitmap.
Now that you have your bitmap configured, you can link a glyphs to it.
In your glyph config, you need to specify the bitmap id, as well as the row and column of the glyph you want to use.
Below is an example of a glyph config using the bitmap above.

```yaml
example_glyph:
  texture: default/chat/example_glyph
  bitmap:
    id: example_bitmap
    row: 1
    column: 1
  #ascent: 8 # Not needed as bitmap specifies it
  #height: 8 # Not needed as bitmap specifies it
```

This will link the glyph to the first emoji on the first row in the image above.

## Emoji List
To make a glyph appear under `/oraxen emojis` you need to specify that it is one, like below.  
If not specified, this will default to `false`
```yaml
heart:
  texture: default/chat/heart
  is_emoji: true
```
It will also, by default, only show emojis the player has the permission for.  
In `settings.yml` you can toggle the `only_show_emojis_with_permission` setting.  
This will show all emojis to every player, and adds a hover-message indicating if they have permission or not.

## How to use it in the chat?

You need to add a chat subsection to your glyph section:

```yaml
chat:
  placeholders:
    - "<3"
  permission: "oraxen.emoji.heart"
```

The placeholders can be used in chat by players with the required permission (if permission is specified, it is not mandatory).

## How to make glyphs tabcomplete?
Simply set `tabcomplete: true` in the chat-section.  
If not specified, this will default to `false`
Tabcompletion is currently only available for servers on 1.19.3 and above.
```yaml
chat:
  tabcomplete: true
  placeholders:
    - "<3"
  permission: "oraxen.emoji.heart"
```


## Grid-Based Glyphs

<Callout type="info">
Grid-based glyphs allow you to use a single large texture that spans multiple unicode characters, perfect for large images, detailed icons, or sprite sheets.
</Callout>

If you have a texture larger than 256x256 pixels, or want to display a large image in chat/lore, you can use the `grid` configuration to split it across multiple characters.

```yaml
large_banner:
  texture: custom/large_banner
  ascent: 8
  height: 128
  grid:
    rows: 2      # Image spans 2 rows
    columns: 3   # Image spans 3 columns
```

The plugin will automatically allocate the required unicode characters (rows × columns) for the glyph. In the example above, 6 characters would be allocated to display the full image.

When using a grid glyph in MiniMessage tags, you can select specific portions:
- `<glyph:large_banner>` - Displays all characters with newlines between rows
- `<glyph:large_banner:1>` - Displays only the 1st character
- `<glyph:large_banner:1..4>` - Displays characters 1 through 4

## Appearance Configuration

Glyphs support an `appearance` section for advanced styling options:

```yaml
custom_icon:
  texture: icons/custom
  ascent: 8
  height: 8
  appearance:
    font: "minecraft:default"   # Custom font (default: minecraft:default)
    shadow_color: "#80000000"   # Shadow color in ARGB hex format (1.21.4+)
```

### Shadow Colors (1.21.4+)

On Minecraft 1.21.4 and above, you can customize the text shadow color for glyphs. The shadow color uses ARGB hex format:
- `#AARRGGBB` - Full format with alpha, red, green, blue
- `#RRGGBB` - RGB format (assumes FF alpha)
- `#RGB` - Short format (expands to #FFRRGGBB)

Example: `#80000000` creates a semi-transparent black shadow.

<Callout type="info">
If a glyph has `shadow_color` configured, the shadow is **automatically applied** when using the glyph tag - no extra flags needed. You only need the `:s:#color` syntax to override with a different color.
</Callout>

## Glyph Tag Options

When using glyphs in MiniMessage format, you can add modifiers:

```
<glyph:heart>              Basic usage (auto-applies configured shadow_color)
<g:heart>                  Shorthand syntax
<glyph:heart:c>            Colorable - inherits surrounding text color
<glyph:heart:colorable>    Same as above (full name)
<glyph:heart:s:#FF0000>    Override shadow with custom color (red)
<glyph:heart:shadow:#FF0000>  Same as above (full name)
<glyph:grid_icon:2>        Select specific character index (1-based)
<glyph:grid_icon:1..4>     Select range of characters
```

Multiple options can be combined:
```
<glyph:heart:c:s:#80FF0000>  Colorable with custom semi-transparent red shadow
```

### Colorable Glyphs

By default, glyphs render in white to display their original texture colors. Using the `:c` or `:colorable` modifier allows the glyph to inherit color from surrounding text:

```
<red>I <glyph:heart:c> Oraxen</red>  // Heart will be red
```

## Shifts (no more shifts.yml)

Oraxen no longer relies on a generated `glyphs/shifts.yml` file. Shifts are now **built-in** using a space font provider that is automatically injected into the default font during pack generation.

- If you still have a `plugins/Oraxen/glyphs/shifts.yml`, it is **deprecated** and can be safely deleted.
- The shift tags still work (e.g. `<shift:8>`), but they are now backed by a **space provider** rather than “fake glyph textures”.

<Callout type="info">
If you previously customized `shifts.yml`, you should migrate that logic to normal glyphs or layout logic. Shifts are now considered infrastructure and are generated automatically.
</Callout>

## Reference Glyphs

Reference glyphs let you **alias part of an existing glyph** (for example: a subset of a grid glyph), without generating a new provider/texture. This keeps packs smaller and makes large GUI glyphs easier to re-use.

Example:

```yaml
gui_header:
  reference:
    glyph: full_gui      # Source glyph ID
    index: 1..3          # Characters to include (1-indexed)
  chat:
    placeholders: [":header:"]
    permission: "gui.header"
```

## Animated Glyphs

Animated glyphs render frames from a **PNG sprite sheet** (frames stacked vertically). Animation is handled by shaders generated by Oraxen during pack generation.

Example:

```yaml
loading:
  texture: animations/loading # Path under plugins/Oraxen/pack/textures (png extension optional)
  animation:
    frames: 12                # Number of frames in the sprite sheet (max: 16)
    fps: 12                   # 1-127 (default: 10)
    loop: true                # default: true
    offset: 0                 # optional horizontal offset, in pixels
  ascent: 8
  height: 16
  chat:
    placeholders: [":loading:"]
```

<Callout type="info">
**Limits:** Animated glyphs support a maximum of **16 frames** per animation. Non-looping animations (`loop: false`) play synchronized to server time, meaning all instances of the same animation will be in sync.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Animated glyphs require Oraxen's pack generation to be enabled and may conflict with other packs that replace Minecraft's text shaders. If you use multiple packs that edit shaders, use the pack merge system and ensure shader files are merged intentionally.
</Callout>

</Callout>

## PlaceholderAPI

### What's my glyph placeholder?
The section name is the glyph id. In this example the glyph id is `heart`, the placeholder is `%oraxen_glyphid%`, so in this example: `%oraxen_heart%`
Glyph-ID is the first line in any glyphs config, it is not the texturename or the placeholder.

### Shift Placeholders

Oraxen provides PlaceholderAPI placeholders for pixel shifts, useful when you need to offset text or glyphs in compatible plugins:

| Placeholder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `%oraxen_shift_N%` | Shifts N pixels to the right (positive) |
| `%oraxen_neg_shift_N%` | Shifts N pixels to the left (negative) |

**Examples:**
- `%oraxen_shift_8%` - Shift 8 pixels to the right
- `%oraxen_shift_16%` - Shift 16 pixels to the right
- `%oraxen_neg_shift_8%` - Shift 8 pixels to the left
- `%oraxen_neg_shift_100%` - Shift 100 pixels to the left

These are the PlaceholderAPI equivalent of the `<shift:N>` MiniMessage tags.

### How do I use this in Prefixes / Luckperms
To add a glyph to a luckperms prefix, commonly to display ranks, simply add `%oraxen_glyphid%` to your prefix solution of choice.
For example, if using LuckPerms, you can use the command: `/lp group default meta setprefix %oraxen_glyphid%` and it will replace it with the glyph.
Because most plugins only parse the placeholders one time, the %luckperms_prefix% will not be parsed again.
You will most likely need to get the Utils-Expansion for PlaceholderAPI aswell.
To get this, go to [this link](https://api.extendedclip.com/media/Utils-Expansion-1.0.1.jar), and place it in your plugins/PlaceholderAPI/expansions folder.
Then in your plugin of choice use `%utils_parse:2_luckperms_prefix%` to parse the prefix again.
Keep in mind your chatplugin must support PlaceholderAPI for this to work.
If this does not work for whatever reason, you can always use the raw unicode from your glyph-config's `char`-property

### How do I use a glyph in name/lore of an item?
Any glyph can be used in name and lore of your item configurations.

```
<glyph:heart>
```

Where heart is replaced by your glyph section name.
