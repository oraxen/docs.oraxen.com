## How does it work?

This mechanic is for items only and does not work with blocks/furniture.\
For that check the [clickAction mechanic](clickaction-mechanic). The mechanics let you create subsections composed of 3 parts:

* **Event**: when is this mechanic triggered? e.g. when you right-click on a block
* **Conditions**: a set of conditions that must be satisfied. e.g. having a permission
* **Actions**: a set of actions to perform. e.g. send a command or a message


An optional settings called oneUsage allows you to imitate the use of an item at 1.


## A comprehensive example

```yaml
Mechanics:
  custom:
    test:
      one_usage: false
      event: "CLICK:right:all"
      conditions:
        - "HAS_PERMISSION:example.permission"
      actions:
        - "[console] give <player> cooked_beef 1"
```

In this example, the subsection `test` defines a custom mechanic triggered when someone right click (on a block or in the air).\
If this player has the permission `example.permission`, the console will perform the give command and replace \<player> by the player name.\
The item won't be consumed (oneUsage: false).
