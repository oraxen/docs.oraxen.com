# Combat Mechanics

<Callout type="info">
All spell-based combat mechanics (Thor, EnergyBlast, WitherSkull, Fireball) support a `charges` option that limits the number of uses before the item is consumed. Set to `-1` or omit for unlimited uses.
</Callout>

### Thor

Have you ever dreamed of being able to throw lightning bolts? This is for you.

#### Per item configuration

```yaml
Mechanics:
  thor:
    lightning_bolts_amount: 5
    random_location_variation: 1.5
    delay: 20000 # in milliseconds (20000ms = 20s)
    charges: -1 # optional: number of uses before item is consumed (-1 for infinite)
```

* **lightning\_bolts\_amount**: how many lightning bolts will be spawned?
* **random\_location\_variation**: the random variation range between bolts (in blocks)
* **delay**: delay between usage in milliseconds (1000ms = 1s)

### Lifeleech

Want to steal hearts to your opponents when you hit them?

#### Per item configuration

```yaml
Mechanics:
  lifeleech:
    amount: 2 # the amount of 1/2 hearts that you'll steal to your opponents
```

### Bleeding

Makes your enemies bleed for a specific amount of time.

#### Per item configuration

```yaml
Mechanics:
  bleeding:
    chance: 0.3 # 30% chance to apply bleeding on hit
    duration: 100 # bleeding lasts for 100 ticks (5 seconds)
    damage_per_interval: 0.5 # deals 0.5 damage (1/4 heart) per interval
    interval: 20 # damage is applied every 20 ticks (1 second)
```

* **chance**: the chance of applying bleeding on hit 
* **duration**: the duration of bleeding in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second)
* **damage\_per\_interval**: the damage dealt per interval
* **interval**: the interval between damages in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second)

### EnergyBlast

EnergyBlast is a very cool mechanic that creates a cone of particles to attack entities.

#### Per item configuration

```yaml
Mechanics:
  energyblast:
    delay: 20000
    length: 5
    damage: 10.0
    charges: -1 # optional: number of uses before item is consumed (-1 for infinite)
    particle:
      type: REDSTONE # only REDSTONE particle can change size and color
      size: 1
      color:
        red: 0
        green: 255
        blue: 255
```

### Witherskull

Send wither skulls when right clicking!

#### Per item configuration

```yaml
Mechanics:
  witherskull:
    charged: false # a charged skull can break blocks
    delay: 3000 # in milliseconds (3000ms = 3s)
    charges: -1 # optional: number of uses before item is consumed (-1 for infinite)
```

### Fireball

Launch fireballs when right clicking! The fireball explodes on impact.

#### Per item configuration

```yaml
Mechanics:
  fireball:
    delay: 3000 # in milliseconds (3000ms = 3s)
    yield: 2.0 # explosion power
    speed: 1.0 # projectile speed
    charges: 5 # optional: number of uses before item is consumed (-1 for infinite)
```
