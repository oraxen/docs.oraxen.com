# Sapling Mechanic


only for 1.136.0+


## How does it work?

This is a variable of the custom blocks, but now you have to have a thread-based hitbox that allows you to make small decorative objects that can be traversed and are more optimized than furniture and the custom\_variation is different from that of the blocks.

### Global Configuration

```yaml
stringblock:
  tool_types:
    - WOODEN
    - STONE
    - IRON
    - GOLDEN
    - DIAMOND
    - NETHERITE
  sapling_growth_check_delay: 4000
  enabled: true
```

## How do I create a sapling?
Add the below section to your stringblock of choice.
```yaml
sapling:
  Mechanics:
    stringblock:
      sapling:
        canGrowNaturally: true # if you want only the player can grow it
        naturalGrowthTime: 6000 #in ticks
        canGrowFromBoneMeal: true
        boneMealGrowChance: 50
        growSound: block.grass.break
        minLightLevel: 4
        requiresWaterSource: false #if you want it to need water
        schematicName: schemTest #structure that will put
```
You can also add some randomness to the growth, or just increase the delay between checks.  
Go into `mechanics.yml` and under stringblock-mechanic, adjust `sapling_growth_check_delay` (20 = 1 second).
