If your server is using 1.19.4 or above, there is a new entity-type called Display-Entities.\
These entities have some additional properties related to furniture-position, that you should set.\
The main one being `display_transform`, which dictates what Transform it should use to display your item.\
You can get a better explanation [here](display_entity_furniture#Display-Entity-Properties).\
Below is an example of a furniture with the `type` set to `ITEM_FRAME` or `DISPLAY_ENTITY` with `display_transform` set to `FIXED`.

To start using furniture without it looking bad you need to adjust its position, let's say you used BlockBench to create the item then go to

Most often, furniture is done using invisible item frames. So, you’ll need to modify the translation settings for “Frame”.

And you got it!
