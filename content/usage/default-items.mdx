### Withooker

![](/assets/withooker.jpg)

Like the magical wand, the **withooker** has a great animation and looks really cool but it currently doesn't have any mechanic so it's up to you to decide what you want to do with it.

## Other weapons

### Dagger

The **dagger** is a really nice weapon that can be used like a sword. By default you can use it faster than a sword.

### Blood sword

### Octavia sword

Like the dagger, the **Octavia sword** is small and nice looking.

### Obsidian sword

As powerful as an iron sword ...but so much durable! The **obsidian sword** is really useful.

The **glass sword** is a pretty powerful sword but with a low durability.

## Tools

### Axe of experience

![](/assets/axe\_of\_experience.jpg)

You can use the **bedrock pickaxe** to break bedrock and go at the top of the nether for example.

### Iron serpe

This tool allows you to harvest: it will automatically recolt and replant wheat!

### Obsidian pickaxe

![](/assets/obsidian\_pickaxe.jpg)

The **obsidian pickaxe** can be used to break a lot of blocks but is similar to an iron pickaxe.

## Hammers

Hammers are very special pickaxes capable of mining several blocks at the same time. Legend says that they were invented by Notch but he didn't have time to add them so he only drew them into the anvil repair interface.

### **Emerald Hammer**

![](/assets/emerald\_hammer.jpg)

The most basic hammer you can find is the **Emerald Hammer**, it mines a square of 3 blocks per 3 blocks, this is cool in order to start but definitively not the best you can get.

### Amethyst Hammer

![](/assets/amethyst\_hammer.jpg)

Unlike the Emerald Hammer, the **Amethyst Hammer** mines a square of 3 blocks per 3 blocks too but with a depth of two blocks.

### Onyx Hammer

![](/assets/onyx\_hammer.jpg)

Take the Amethyst Hammer, improve it and you've got the **Onyx Hammer**. It can break more blocks than the Amethyst Hammer because it has a big durability.

### Orax Hammer

![](/assets/orax\_hammer.jpg)

Compared to his brothers, the **Orax Hammer** is a god like hammer : it can mine a really big square with a depth of two blocks.

### Fire Hammer

![](/assets/fire\_hammer.jpg)

The **Fire Hammer** mines like a basic hammer (3 blocks per 3 blocks, depth of 1) but it actually melts ores instantly! If you mine iron ore for example you'll immediatly get rewarded with iron ingots ...and it stacks with fortune!
