# MythicHUD

<Callout type="info">
  HappyHUD has been rebranded to **MythicHUD** and is now part of the MythicCraft ecosystem. If you're migrating from HappyHUD, MythicHUD includes automatic migration support.
</Callout>

This will detail how to properly make MythicHUD compatible with Oraxen.

## Setup Steps

1. Set `hide_scoreboard_numbers: false` in settings.yml
2. Delete `Oraxen/pack/shaders/core/render_text.vsh` and `render_text.json` if they exist
3. In MythicHUD's config, enable `copy-resource-pack` and set `path: "Oraxen/pack/assets"`

## Hiding Scoreboard Numbers

If you really want to also hide scoreboard numbers, you can manually merge Oraxen's shader file into MythicHUD's in `MythicHUD/pack/minecraft/shaders/core/`.
