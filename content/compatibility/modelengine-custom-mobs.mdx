# ModelEngine - custom mobs

Using ModelEngine with Oraxen is very simple as long as you use different types of items. As far as I know, ModelEngine uses leather horse armor. If you don't, compatibility should be simple.

## How to merge?

Go to the ModelEngine folder. It should look like that:

Open the `resource pack` folder:

Copy the assets folder (the folder, not its content) inside `Oraxen/pack`, this should look like this:
