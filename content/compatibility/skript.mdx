# Skript Integration

Oraxen includes built-in Skript compatibility that loads automatically when [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) is present on the server. This allows you to use Oraxen items, custom blocks, and furniture directly in your scripts.

<Callout type="info">
  Skript 2.9+ is recommended for full compatibility.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

No configuration needed! Simply have both Oraxen and Skript installed on your server. Oraxen will automatically detect Skript and register all syntax elements.

You'll see this message in console when it loads:
```
[Oraxen] Skript compatibility enabled - Oraxen syntax registered
```

## Complete Example Script

on join:
    give player oraxen item "welcome_gift"
    send "&aWelcome! You received a custom gift!"

# Custom wand effect
on right click:
    if player's tool is oraxen item "magic_wand":
        strike lightning at target block
        send "&eZap!" to player

# Protect special blocks
on oraxen block break of "admin_block":
    if player does not have permission "oraxen.admin":
        cancel event
        send "&cYou don't have permission to break this!" to player

# Custom furniture shop
on oraxen furniture interact of "shop_counter":
    open virtual chest inventory with 3 rows named "&6Shop" to player
    # Add shop items...

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning">
  If Skript syntax doesn't work, ensure:
  - Skript is properly installed and enabled
  - You see the "Skript compatibility enabled" message in console
  - You're using Skript 2.9 or newer
</Callout>

### Common Issues

**Syntax not recognized:**
- Reload Skript with `/skript reload all`
- Check console for parsing errors
- Verify Oraxen loaded successfully

**Item ID not found:**
- Ensure the Oraxen item exists in your configuration
- Check for typos in the item ID
- Item IDs are case-sensitive

**Events not triggering:**
- Verify the specific event exists (not all vanilla events trigger Oraxen events)
- Check if the block/furniture is actually from Oraxen
