# RealisticWorldGenerator

<Callout type="warning">
  **Archived**: RealisticWorldGenerator only supports Minecraft 1.8.8 - 1.17.1 and does not work on Minecraft 1.18+.
</Callout>

## Status

RealisticWorldGenerator does not work on Minecraft 1.18 and above. The developers have announced a rewrite to support modern versions, but it is not yet available.

If you need to use RealisticWorldGenerator worlds on 1.18+, you can generate the world on a 1.17.1 server first and then transfer it to your newer server.

## Alternative

For modern Minecraft versions, we recommend using [Iris World Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/iris-world-gen-the-dimension-engine.84586/) which actively supports the latest Minecraft versions and has native Oraxen block support.

See our [Iris World Generator documentation](/compatibility/world-generators/iris-world-generator) for integration details.

## Legacy Information

RealisticWorldGenerator allowed custom ore generation with Oraxen blocks on servers running Minecraft 1.17.1 and below. The integration worked through custom BlockData configuration.
