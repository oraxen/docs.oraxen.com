# BossShopPro

<Callout type="warning">
  **Archived**: The original BossShopPro plugin is no longer actively maintained and does not support Minecraft 1.17+.
</Callout>

## Status

The original BossShopPro by Blackixx is no longer being updated. The developer stated that due to time constraints, they are not actively updating the plugin anymore.

## Alternative

If you need shop functionality, consider using [BossShopPro Continued](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bossshoppro-continued-now-free.104824/), which is a community-maintained fork that supports modern Minecraft versions.

## Legacy Information

BossShopPro was a powerful chest GUI shop/menu plugin. If you're still running an older server version (1.16 and below), Oraxen items could be used with BossShopPro through standard item configuration.
