# CrateReloaded

<Callout type="info">
  **Note**: CrateReloaded is still maintained but this documentation page was never completed. The plugin works with Oraxen items through standard item ID configuration.
</Callout>

## Using Oraxen Items with CrateReloaded

CrateReloaded supports custom items through its reward configuration. You can use Oraxen items by referencing them with the `oraxen:` prefix or by using the item's custom model data.

Refer to the [CrateReloaded documentation](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/free-crate-reloaded-mystery-crate-1-8-1-20-x.861/) for the latest configuration syntax.
