# EpicWorldGenerator

<Callout type="warning">
  **Archived**: EpicWorldGenerator only supports Minecraft 1.15 - 1.17.1 and has not been updated for modern versions.
</Callout>

## Status

EpicWorldGenerator's last supported version is Minecraft 1.17.1. The plugin does not work on Minecraft 1.18 and above due to significant changes in world generation APIs.

## Alternative

For modern Minecraft versions, we recommend using [Iris World Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/iris-world-gen-the-dimension-engine.84586/) which actively supports the latest Minecraft versions and has native Oraxen block support.

See our [Iris World Generator documentation](/compatibility/world-generators/iris-world-generator) for integration details.

## Legacy Information

EpicWorldGenerator allowed custom ore generation with Oraxen blocks on servers running Minecraft 1.17.1 and below. If you're still running an older server, the integration worked through custom BlockData configuration similar to other world generators.
