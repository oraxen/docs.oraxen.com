# World Generators

Oraxen doesn't natively support ore generation. Instead, you can use world generators to spawn custom ores and blocks in your world.

## Recommended: Iris World Generator

[Iris World Generator](/compatibility/world-generators/iris-world-generator) features **first-class Oraxen integration**. Oraxen automatically registers as an external data provider with Iris, allowing you to reference custom blocks using the `oraxen:block_id` syntax directly in your Iris configurations - no additional setup required.

## Alternative: Custom Ore Generator

[Custom Ore Generator](/compatibility/world-generators/custom-ore-generator) is a free alternative for adding custom ores to your world.

For discontinued world generators (EpicWorldGenerator, RealisticWorldGenerator), see the [Archives](/compatibility/archives) section.

## Find your ores' custom block data

For most custom world generators you need to find your custom block data. This can be achieved using any minecraft version on a server running Oraxen. Just place your block (you can get it from the oraxen inventory of give it to yourself through a command) and press F3 while looking at the block you want to add.
