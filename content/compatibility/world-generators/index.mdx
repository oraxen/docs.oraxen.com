Oraxen doesn't natively support ores generation, instead you can use world generators like [Iris World Generator](/compatibility/world-generators/iris-world-generator) or [Custom Ore Generator](/compatibility/world-generators/custom-ore-generator).

For discontinued world generators (EpicWorldGenerator, RealisticWorldGenerator), see the [Archives](/compatibility/archives) section.

## Find your ores' custom block data

For most custom world generators you need to find your custom block data. This can be achieved using any minecraft version on a server running Oraxen. Just place your block (you can get it from the oraxen inventory of give it to yourself through a command) and press F3 while looking at the block you want to add.
