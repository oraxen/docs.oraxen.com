# Iris World Generator

Iris World Generator allows you to easily generate beautiful worlds with custom terrain, biomes, and structures. It features **first-class Oraxen integration**, allowing you to use custom blocks and items from Oraxen directly in your world generation configurations.

<Callout type="info">
  Oraxen automatically registers as an external data provider with Iris. Just install both plugins and the integration works out of the box - no additional setup required.

## Using Oraxen blocks in Iris

You can reference any Oraxen custom block using the `oraxen:` prefix followed by your block's ID. Iris will automatically resolve these references through Oraxen's data provider.

```
oraxen:your_block_id
```

## How to create custom ores

In this example we assume that you have added a block (an amethyst ore for example) following [this example](/creating-content/blocks/noteblock#ores) to your oraxen configuration.

### 1) Locate your dimension configuration

Go to `Iris/pack/YOUR_PACK_NAME/dimensions/YOUR_DIMENSION_NAME.json`, by default this should be: `Iris/packs/overworld/dimensions/overworld.json`

Then, open the file (or the vscode workspace to enjoy the cool vscode integration).

### 2) Add your ore!

Locate this part of the config:

```yaml
    "ORES": "All settings in regards to deposits. Contains the ores spawning in your world.",
    "deposits": [
        {
            "minHeight": 19,
            "maxPerChunk": 4,
            "maxHeight": 150,
            "minPerChunk": 1,
            "minSize": 25,
            "maxSize": 25,
            "palette": [{"block": "granite"}],
            "varience": 2
        },
```

Add your own config using the custom ore properties found at step one. For example:

```yaml
    {
      "minHeight": 2,
      "maxPerChunk": 2,
      "maxHeight": 30,
      "minPerChunk": 0,
      "minSize": 3,
      "maxSize": 6,
      "palette": [{ "block": "oraxen:amethyst_ore" }],
      "varience": 5
    },
```

You can now save the file, reset your world and restart!
