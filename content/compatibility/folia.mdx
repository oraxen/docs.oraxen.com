# Folia Compatibility

Oraxen includes native support for [Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia), PaperMC's high-performance, multithreaded server fork.

## What is Folia?

Folia is a fork of Paper that uses a regionized threading model. Instead of running everything on a single main thread, Folia divides the world into independent regions, each processed on its own thread. This allows for significantly better performance on large servers with many players spread across different areas.

## How Oraxen Works with Folia

Oraxen automatically detects Folia at startup and uses the appropriate scheduling APIs:

- **Region Scheduler**: For block operations (custom blocks, furniture barriers, etc.)
- **Entity Scheduler**: For entity operations (furniture entities, players, etc.)
- **Global Scheduler**: For operations that don't involve specific regions
- **Async Scheduler**: For I/O operations (resource pack upload, etc.)

## No Configuration Required

Oraxen's Folia support is completely transparent - no configuration changes are needed. The plugin will:

1. Detect Folia automatically at startup
2. Use thread-safe collections where needed
3. Schedule tasks on the appropriate region/entity threads
4. Fall back to standard Bukkit scheduling on non-Folia servers

## Compatibility Notes

All Oraxen features work on Folia, including:

- ✅ Custom items and blocks
- ✅ Furniture placement and interaction
- ✅ Custom block mechanics (noteblocks, stringblocks)
- ✅ Combat mechanics (bleeding, spear lunge, etc.)
- ✅ Resource pack generation and dispatch
- ✅ Glyphs and custom fonts
- ✅ HUD displays
- ✅ All other mechanics

## Requirements

- **Folia**: Any recent version
- **Oraxen**: Version 1.201.0 or later
- **Java**: 21 or later (required by Folia)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues on Folia:

1. Ensure you're using Oraxen 1.201.0 or later
2. Check the console for any scheduler-related errors at startup
3. Report issues on the [Oraxen GitHub](https://github.com/oraxen/oraxen/issues) with your Folia version and full error logs
