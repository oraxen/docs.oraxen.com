# Crucible / Mythic Items

The compatibility with Crucible allows you to import items created with MythicMobs & Crucible and use them as a base for your Oraxen items (you will keep everything configured with Crucible and add your own mechanics, textures, 3d models, etc).

To do this, simply add a crucible section and specify the itemID in Oraxen

```yaml
example_crucible:
  displayname: "<gradient:#59A7EA:#F1D2FF>Test"
  crucible:
    id: my_crucible_itemid
```
