Unlike most other plugins that allow you to create custom items, oraxen supports the creation of a texture pack: that is, you can define directly in the configuration what you want your items to look like and it will take care of generating the pack. For minecraft, the appearance of each item is managed by a json file called the model. Most of the items have a very simple model that simply displays a two-dimensional texture. To avoid having to write this json file (which is repetitive and boring), you can ask Oraxen to generate it itself.

### The pack folder

This folder (./plugins/Oraxen/pack) contains your pack. It works like a normal minecraft texture pack but simpler. You can drag your textures into the textures folder and your models into your models folder. You can also create sub-folders inside these folders to make it cleaner but it's not necessary. When the plugin generates the resource pack it appears in this folder under the name pack.zip.

### Create a simple 2d item

Put the textures that you need in the textures directory of the pack folder. You can then ask Oraxen to generate the model by superposing the textures :

```yaml
  Pack:
    generate_model: true
    parent_model: "item/handheld"
    textures:
      - example_image1.png #png extension is not needed
      - example_image2.png
```

The parent\_model field is required by minecraft. In fact this will allow your item to inherit the rendering properties of an item template from minecraft. You can look at the minecraft default models in order to find new ones but I personnaly use item/handheld for weapons like swords and item/generated for simple items or gems like amethysts.

You can also use an alternative way of declaring textures, especially nice when using block parent-models.\
```yaml
Pack:
  generate_model: true
  parent_model: "block/cube"
  textures:
    top: example_image.png
    side: example_image2.png
```

### Use a json model

Creating a json model can be time-consuming but it allows you to create really cool things (like 3d items). It is really easy to integrate a json model with Oraxen : put your textures in your textures directory and your model in your models directory (inside Oraxen/pack folder). Then you can ask Oraxen to put this model on one of your items:


ALWAYS USE LOWER CASE FOR MODEL AND TEXTURE NAMES. Upper case is n longer supported by minecraft vanilla since 1.11 (even though it still works for users using optifine).


```yaml
  Pack:
    generate_model: false
    model: example_model.json #json extension is not mandatory
```

#### ⚠️ Pro tips when you use a json model!

Usually the templates you get place the textures in a folder, to make sure, open the json file and look at the first few lines, you should find something similar:

```json
{
	"__comment": "Designed by HighBridRed for Oraxen",
	"textures": {
		"particle": "custom/bonesword_palette",
		"texture": "custom/bonesword_palette",
		"bonesword_palette": "custom/bonesword_palette"
	},
	...
```

As you can see, the path to the texture is **custom/bonesword\_palette**, that means minecraft will be looking for a texture called **bonesword\_palette.png** in the folder "custom", so you need to create this folder inside "Oraxen/pack/textures". You can also remove "custom/" and keep the texture name only, so you just have to drag and drop it inside the textures folder without creating a subfolder.

### Use a blocking json model (for shield)
If you want to use a custom model for a shield, you need to specific the blocking model which will be used when\
a user right click using your shield, hopefully this is easy with Oraxen. Here is what it can look like:

```yaml
  Pack:
    generate_model: false
    model: example_shield.json #json extension is not mandatory
    blocking_model: example_shield_blocking.json #json extension is not mandatory
```

### Use a pulling json model (for bows)
If you want to use a custom model for a shield, you need to specific the pulling model which will be\
used when a user right click using your bow, hopefully this is easy with Oraxen.\
Here is what it can look like:

```yaml
  Pack:
    generate_model: false
    model: default/combat_bow
    pulling_models:
      - default/combat_bow_pulling_0
      - default/combat_bow_pulling_1
      - default/combat_bow_pulling_2
```
This also works with pulling_textures if you only have texture files

### Use charged_model json model (for Crossbows)

```yml
  Pack:
    generate_model: false
    model: default/custom_bow
    pulling_models:
      - default/custom_bow_pulling_0
      - default/custom_bow_pulling_1
      - default/custom_bow_pulling_2
    charged_model: default/custom_bow_pulling_2
    firework_model: default/custom_bow_charged #not so necessary
```
This also works with charged_texture & firework_texture if you only have texture files

### Use cast_model json model (for fishing rods)

```yml
  Pack:
    generate_model: false
    model: default/fishing_rod
    cast_model: default/fishing_rod_cast
```
This also works with cast_texture if you only have texture files

### Use damaged_model json model (for different durability levels)
```yml
Pack:
  generate_model: false
  model: default/diamond_sword
  damaged_models:
    - default/diamond_sword_damaged1
    - default/diamond_sword_damaged2
    - default/diamond_sword_damaged3
```
This also works with damaged_textures if you only have texture files

### Use advanced model properties (Minecraft 1.21.4+)

Since Minecraft 1.21.4, you can customize additional item model properties:

**GUI Oversize**
Allows items to extend beyond slot boundaries in GUI when scaled up

```yaml
  Pack:
    generate_model: false
    model: item/large_item
    oversized_in_gui: true
```

When combined with a scaled display model like this, it creates an item that stands out prominently in inventory slots.

```json
{
	"parent": "item/handheld",
	"textures": {
		"layer0": "default/welcome_disk"
	},
	"display": {
		"gui": {
			"translation": [-2, -2, 0],
			"scale": [2, 2, 2]
		}
	}
}
```
See how oversized rendering looks in practice.

Here is an example use case provided by Wollodriin.

**Hand Swap Animation**
Controls whether hand animation plays when swapping items (only when switching from an item to another item)

```yaml
  Pack:
    generate_model: false
    model: item/example_item
    hand_animation_on_swap: false
```

**Hand Swap Animation Scale**
Adjusts the scale of the swap animation

```yaml
  Pack:
    generate_model: false
    model: item/example_item
    swap_animation_scale: 1.5
```
