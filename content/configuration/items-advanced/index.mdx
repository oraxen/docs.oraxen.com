# Items (Advanced)

## Vanilla options

### Components

Since Minecraft 1.20.5, items use data-driven components. This is a powerful system that allows you to customize durability, stack size, food properties, equipment slots, and more.

See the dedicated [Components page](./components) for full documentation.

### ItemTemplate

This allows you to easily copy properties from a template-item onto other items.\
In the template item:

```yml
template_item:
  template: true
  material: DIAMOND_SWORD
  ...
```

In the item you want to copy the properties to:

```yml
template_item1:
  template: template_item
  displayname: Template Item 1

template_item2:
  template: template_item
  displayname: Template Item 2
  material: CLOCK
```

### Custom Name

This allows you to change the name displayed on the top of an item.

<Tabs items={['1.20.5+', '1.18-1.20.4']}>
<Tabs.Tab title="1.20.5+">
```yaml
my_item:
  itemname: "<red><bold>Example" #example name
  #customname: "example" #Should only be used for legacy-compatibility
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="1.18-1.20.4">
```yaml
my_item:
  displayname: "<red><bold>Example" #example name
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Material

This allows you to change the item type

```yaml
my_item:
  material: WOODEN_SWORD
```

### Color

This allows you to change the color of an item made of a supported material (e.g. leather armor).

```yaml
my_item:
  color: 3, 252, 136 #rgb
```

### Lore

This allows you to add lines of text under the item name.

```yaml
my_item:
  lore:
  - "One line"
  - "<green>Another line"
```

### injectID

This allows Oraxen to know recognise the item, it is by default set to true and you should not have to change it. If you do it anyway, the mechanics of the items will no longer work.

```yaml
my_item:
  injectID: false
```

### Disable Enchanting

This options allows you to prevent an item from being enchanted via anvils or enchantment tables.\
This does not prevent enchantments from being applied in the config.

```yaml
my_item:
  disable_enchanting: true
```

### excludeFromInventory

This option allows you to exclude an item from the oraxen inventory. It will no longer be displayed but you can still get it using [oraxen give command](../../usage/commands#get-the-items). It is useful for items used in other plugins like inventory icons.

```yaml
  excludeFromInventory: true
```

### unbreakable

This will make your item unbreakable (for real, using minecraft dedicated property).

```yaml
my_item:
  unbreakable: true
```

### ItemFlags

This allows you to set ItemFlags to an item, get the list of available flags [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/inventory/ItemFlag.html).

```yaml
my_item:
  ItemFlags:
    - HIDE_ENCHANTS
    - HIDE_ATTRIBUTES
    - HIDE_UNBREAKABLE
    - HIDE_DESTROYS
    - HIDE_PLACED_ON
    - HIDE_POTION_EFFECTS
```

### PotionEffects

This allows you to add custom Potion Effects to your potion. Get the list of available effects [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html).

```yaml
my_item:
  PotionEffects:
    # - type: Get the list here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html
    # - duration: in ticks
    # - amplifier: potion effects level
    # - ambient: true/false, makes potion effect produce more, translucent, particles.
    # - particles: true/false, whether this effect has particles or not
    # - icon: true/false, whether this effect has an icon or not
    - { type: WITHER,
        duration: 200,
        amplifier: 2,
        ambient: false,
        particles: true,
        icon: true }
```

### AttributeModifiers

This allows you to add minecraft attributes to your item. They are very powerful and allow you to make an item that adds hearts, increases the player's speed, etc. Get the list of available attributes [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/attribute/Attribute.html).

```yaml
my_item:
  AttributeModifiers:
    # - attribute: Get the list here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/attribute/Attribute.html
    # - operations: 0 for ADD_NUMBER, 1 for ADD_SCALAR, 2 for MULTIPLY_SCALAR_1;
    # - slot: HAND, OFF_HAND, FEET, LEGS, CHEST or HEAD
    -  attribute: GENERIC_MOVEMENT_SPEED, 
       amount: 0.1, 
       operation: 0, 
       slot: HAND
```

### Enchantments

If you want to enchant your item (even with non vanilla levels like for example sharpness 15), you can do it with this section.

```yaml
my_item:
  Enchantments:
    protection: 4
    flame: 34
    sharpness: 18
```
