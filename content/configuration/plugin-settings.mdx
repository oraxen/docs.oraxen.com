## Plugin

```yaml
Plugin:
  commands:
    repair:
      oraxen_durability_only: false # will not repair vanilla items if set to true
```

The plugin related options. Here you can configure how some things work. Should the repair only repair Oraxen items with an oraxen durability?

## Item configurations

### How do the Oraxen configurations work?

First, Oraxen has several folders and 3 of these are to configure things, the first one is `Oraxen/ghyphs/` and is to configure the Custom Font or Ghyph, then\
`Oraxen/items/` and is to configure and create your own configuration yaml and lastly `Oraxen/pack/` the target place where all the files like textures and models will be created,

## Pack

### Generation

```yaml
  generation:
    generate: true
    compression: BEST_COMPRESSION # see Deflater.class
    # protection will use several methods to make your pack impossible to extract
    # with usual tools (native windows unzip, 7zip, winrar, etc) without altering
    # its integrity. Be careful if you activate this option to not try to extract
    # the pack or you might fill your disk.
    protection: true
    comment: "The content of this texture pack
     \nbelongs to the owner of the Oraxen
     \nplugin and any complete or partial
     \nuse must comply with the terms and
     \nconditions of Oraxen."
```

This section allows you to configure the **generation** of the pack. The **compression** is configured to make the smallest zip possible by default. You can change the **comment** which is basically a watermark inside your zip.

#### Protection

Protection will allow you to prevent players from stealing your textures easily. This won't make your pack heavier but if you enabled it. You **shall not** try to extract the generated zip, this could damage your disk.

![1 Exabyte (EB) = 1000000000 Gigabyte (GB)](/assets/size.png)

![Your operating system should prevent you from extracting in order to preserve your disk integrity](/assets/extraction.png)

### Upload

```yaml
    enabled: true
    type: polymath #transfer.sh or polymath
    polymath:
      server: atlas.oraxen.com # you can also host your own polymath instance
```

Oraxen integrates with Polymath (a custom web server written in Python especially to be compatible). You can download the source code [here](https://github.com/Th0rgal/Polymath/) and host it yourself or use the provided instance (atlas). You can also integrate with [your own custom hosting service](../developers/custom-hosting-service).

### Dispatch

This section allows you to easily perform actions depending on the resource pack status of your players.

You can send message (through a KICK, the chat, an actionbar or a title) and specify a delay and a period (between the different messages if you are using an actionbar or a title).

```yaml
receive:
  enabled: true

  loaded:
    actions:
      message:
        enabled: true
        # KICK / CHAT / ACTION_BAR / TITLE
        type: ACTION_BAR
        # Delay before the first message to appear, this is in seconds
        delay: 0
        # You only need a period if you send multiple messages of type ACTION_BAR or TITLE
        period: -1
        # Click and Hover elements are only available by using the CHAT type
        messages:
          - "<green><bold>ResourcePack successfully loaded!"

      # If you need to send commands
      commands:
        console: []
        player: []
        opped_player: []

  accepted:
    actions:
      message:
        enabled: true
        # KICK / CHAT / ACTION_BAR / TITLE
        type: TITLE
        # Delay before the first message to appear, this is in seconds
        delay: 0
        # You only need a period if you send multiple messages of type ACTION_BAR or TITLE
        period: 3
        # Click and Hover elements are only available by using the CHAT type
        messages:
          - "<green><bold>ResourcePack accepted!"
          - "Thank you"
      # If you need to send commands
      commands:
        console: []
        player: []
        opped_player: []

  denied:
    actions:
      message:
        enabled: true
        # KICK / CHAT / ACTION_BAR / TITLE
        type: CHAT
        # Delay before the first message to appear, this is in seconds
        delay: 0
        # You can put any value here because this is a CHAT message
        period: -1
        # Click and Hover elements are only available by using the CHAT type
        messages:
          - "<red>You refused the ResourcePack, but you need it in order to see the new items. Please </red><click:run_command:/oraxen pack><hover:show_text:\"<green>Display more informations\"><green><bold>CLICK HERE</bold></hover></click> <red>or type <bold>/o pack"
      # If you need to send commands
      commands:
        console: []
        player: []
        opped_player: []

  failed_download:
    actions:
      message:
        enabled: true
        # KICK / CHAT / ACTION_BAR / TITLE
        type: CHAT
        # Delay before the first message to appear, this is in seconds
        delay: 0
        # You can put any value here because this is a CHAT message
        period: -1
        # Click and Hover elements are only available by using the CHAT type
        messages:
          - "<red>You failed to download the ResourcePack, but you need it in order to see the new items. Please </red><click:run_command:/oraxen pack getpack><hover:show_text:\"<red>/!\\ loading the resourcepack from the game can cause lags\"><red><bold>CLICK HERE</bold></hover></click> <red>to retry or type <bold>/o pack</bold> and download it from the internet"
      # If you need to send commands
      commands:
        console: []
        player: []
        opped_player: []
```

## ConfigTools

```yaml
  enable_configs_updater: true
  error_item:
    material: PODZOL
    excludeFromInventory: false # set to true if you don't want to display it inside inventory
    injectID: false
```

## CustomArmor

```yaml
CustomArmor:
  disable_leather_repair: true
```

This option lets you disable leather being able to repair custom armors.\
This means the only way to repair a custom armor set is other copies of said armor set.

## Misc

### hide\_scoreboard\_numbers

This option lets you hide the red scoreboard numbers.

```yaml
  hide_scoreboard_numbers: true
```

### hide\_scoreboard\_background

This option lets you hide the scoreboard background.

```yaml
  hide_scoreboard_background: true
```

### reset\_recipes

```yaml

```

This option can causes bug with other recipes plugins. If you notice bugs with a recipes plugin when reloading Oraxen, you can disable this option. If you do that, you will have to restart the server to refresh Oraxen recipes.
